#### Why Python for RESTful API Backends?
1. **Ease of Development**
   - Python is known for its simple, readable syntax, making it easier to develop and maintain APIs.
   - Frameworks like Flask and Django offer rapid development tools and built-in features to streamline backend implementation.

2. **Rich Ecosystem**
   - Python has a vast library ecosystem, providing modules for data processing, authentication, database interactions, and more.
   - Libraries like SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, and Flask-RESTful simplify API development.

3. **Strong Support for REST**
   - Python frameworks are designed with REST principles in mind, providing decorators and utilities to build APIs efficiently.
   - Frameworks like Django REST Framework (DRF) offer advanced features for serialization, authentication, and permissions.

4. **Integration with Data Science**
   - Python is widely used in data science, making it easy to integrate APIs with machine learning models or analytics.
   - APIs can directly serve insights, predictions, or process-heavy computations from Python-based ML models.

5. **Scalability**
   - Python applications can be containerized (e.g., Docker) and scaled using Kubernetes (EKS) to meet high-demand scenarios.
   - Asynchronous frameworks like FastAPI offer enhanced performance for concurrent requests.

6. **Community and Support**
   - Python has a large, active community that provides robust support, plugins, and extensions for backend development.

7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Python APIs can run on any platform, ensuring flexibility in deployment environments.

### Define Containerized Deployment:
- Dockerize the API application
- Use Kubernetes manifests (e.g., Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets) to define API workloads
